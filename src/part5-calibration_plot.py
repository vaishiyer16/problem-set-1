PART 5: Calibration-light
Use `calibration_plot` function to create a calibration curve for the logistic regression model. Set `n_bins` to 5. (The calibration plot may have less than 5 points, that's ok) 
Use `calibration_plot` function to create a calibration curve for the decision tree model. Set `n_bins` to 5. (The calibration plot may have less than 5 points, that's ok)
