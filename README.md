Instructions: 
- Clone the Problem Set code package from GitHub: 
- You will use arrest data for each part of this assignment. The links are found in src/etl.py in the code package. 
  - Remember to spend some time to get to know the data before you start on pre-processing and analysis
- Each of the .py files in `/src` contain instructions for the exepected code you are to write


Before you start:
- Make sure to setup a virtual environment as discussed in the Course Tech Setup lecture. Here's a short article as an additional resource:

- Don't forget to set your requirements.txt file using pip freeze > requirements.txt 

When you're done:
- Commit and push this code package to your GitHub account
  - A good practice is to use simple commit comments and  commit code after you've finished each feature. Commit and push often

Submission: 
You will submit the GitHub URL for this repo in ELMS.

Grading: 
We will look to make sure you've output the correct print statements and CSV files. We will only run main.py, so make sure to stucture this correctly. Credit will be given for adhering to the course's Code Standards and Data Standards, using GitHub correctly, and producing the correct output, among other considerations.
